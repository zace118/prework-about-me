      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a student going through the full-stack bootcamp course at University of Arizona. I aspire to work and lead a team of driven developers to make the experiences on the web more user friendly.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Born and raised in Clovis, New Mexico. Lived there for 10 years until my dad got a promotion at work which moved us to Flagstaff, AZ. I love and miss that town everyday!</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Drumming, video games, listening to music and podcasts, mixology, playing with my puppers (I have a woofer, a pooper, and a chonk). </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I want a job where I will be able to use all of my skills together. I want to be creative, to lead people, and to work together as a team to complete projects.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Currently living in the Tempe/Mesa area.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I am striving to not only better myself, but I want a better life. I was a restaurant manager before this and I actually really liked it at its core. But the work/life balance was terrible. I hope that following this path will lead me to a career I am passionate about, happy to go to everyday, gives me stable pay to live with, and a healthy work/life balance.</p>
